                    Suvidha Foundation recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from donors and visitors to our website. We maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private and secure.
                    <br />          <br />
                    Mercy Corps follows industry standards on information security based on CIS (Center for Internet Security) controls to safeguard sensitive information including strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and security awareness training for all team members. As a PCI DSS compliant organization we perform quarterly security scans and yearly security audits by a third party qualified security assessor.
                    <br />          <br />
                    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is accessible only to staff and volunteers who need it for a business purpose.  Confidential data, including PII, is protected via role-based access controls to ensure that it is not improperly disclosed, modified, deleted, or rendered unavailable.   Access to systems or applications that manage confidential data requires approval by Mercy Corps’ Information Security Department. All sensitive and confidential data, regardless of storage location, will be retained only as long as required for legal, regulatory, and business requirements. All media containing PII data is wiped and destroyed at the end of its life cycle. Mercy Corps team members are required to read and sign Mercy Corps’ Information Security Awareness and Communications Acceptable Use Policy which outlines best practices in this area, and acknowledge and adhere to Mercy Corps’ Responsible Data Policy.

                    In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations. Donors who make their first gift to Mercy Corps in response to an appeal letter may be included on this exchange list; all other donors are automatically excluded from the exchange. All donors who made their first gift to Mercy Corps before January 31, 2004 are also excluded from the exchange. At least once a year, we will inform all donors who are eligible to be included on the exchange list, and give them an opportunity to opt out of future exchanges. Donors who wish to have their names removed from the exchange list can call 1-888-842-0842 or email donorservices@mercycorps.org. </div>
